# Graphql api

Followed a tutorial online to play around with graphql.

### Learnings

It's pretty awesome how flexible the querying becomes - I'm thinking of times in projects where we've used REST, and how much over-fetching we have to do to resolve a complex queury.

GraphQL feels a bit closer to the object-like data that we tend to work with in modern applications. I can see why more greenfield projects are using a combo of managed no-sql dbs and graphql.
